When convolution1.cu is run on Yoko:

MASK_SIZE=11: 1906.714ms
MASK_SIZE=15: 2614.162ms
MASK_SIZE=21: 3629.958ms

When convolution2.cu is run on Yoko:

MASK_SIZE=11: 920.328ms
MASK_SIZE=15: 1118.374ms
MASK_SIZE=21: 1247.308ms

The first program's runtimes are much higher, and grow from 2x the second program's runtime with a mask size of 11 to 3x when the mask size is 21. This is because the benefits of using shared memory only increase as the mask is bigger and more computation needs to be done.
