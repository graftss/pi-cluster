When the serial program is run on the Yoko server:

10 trials:      0.008916ms
1000 trials:    0.479183ms
100000 trials: 70.752070ms

While the serial program does better for 10 and 1000 trials, the CUDA implementation overtakes it on the 100000 trial program, which is a large enough program that the parallelism of CUDA outweighs the overhead of the kernel launch.
