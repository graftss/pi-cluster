When the parallel program is run on the Yoko server:

N = 10000:   0.226816ms
N = 100000:  0.260544ms
N = 1000000: 3.216000ms

When the serial program is run on the Yoko server:

N = 10000:    0.071028ms
N = 100000:   0.695531ms
N = 1000000: 10.711551ms

While the serial program wins out for the smallest value of N, the CUDA implementation outperforms it for the larger two values of N.
