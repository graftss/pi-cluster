To sort 30 million integers on 2 nodes, we will sort 15 million per node, with the command:

mpiexec -n 2 -hostfile hostfile.txt ./qs 15000000

Similar, to sort 30 million integers on 1 node, use the command:

mpiexec -n 1 -hostfile hostfile.txt ./qs 30000000

Resulting times for each case:
With 3 nodes: 4.81199 seconds
With 2 nodes: 5.05438 seconds
With 1 nodes: 6.3616 seconds

We see that using 2 or 3 nodes yields far less than a 2x or 3x speedup, respectively. Presumably this is because of the large amount of overhead when sending so much data from the root node to the child nodes.
