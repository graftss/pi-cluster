When the parallel program is run on the Yoko server:

10 trials:      0.245504ms
1000 trials:    0.581984ms
100000 trials: 33.025345ms

The runtimes show an increase of much less than 100x, the rate at which the number of trials increases. This is because for such a small program, the overhead of launching the CUDA kernel is quite large compared to the actual work being performed by the kernel.
